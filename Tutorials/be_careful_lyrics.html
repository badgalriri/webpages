				<h3>Intro</h3>
				Yeah
				Care for me, care for me, care for me, uh
				Yeah, look
			</div>

			<h3>Verse 1</h3>
			<p>
				I wanna get married, like the Currys, Steph and Ayesha shit<br>
				But we more like Bellyâ€”Tommy and Keisha shit<br>
				Gave you TLC, you wanna creep and shit<br>
				Poured out my whole heart to a piece of shit<br>
				Man, I thought you would've learned your lesson<br>
				'Bout likin' pictures, not returnin' texts<br>
				I guess it's fine, man, I get the message<br>
				You still stutter after certain questions<br>
				You keep in contact with certain exes<br>
				Do you, though, trust me, nigga, it's cool, though<br>
				Said that you was workin', but you out here chasin' culo<br>
				And putas, chillin' poolside, livin' two lives<br>
				I could've did what you did to me to you a few times<br>
				But if I did decide to slide, find a nigga<br>
				Fuck him, suck his dick, you would've been pissed<br>
				But that's not my M.O., I'm not that type of bitch<br>
				And karma for you is gon' be who you end up with<br>
				You make me sick, nigga<br>
			</p>

			<h3>Chorus</h3>
			<p>
				The only man, baby, I adore<br>
				I gave you everything, what's mine is yours<br>
				I want you to live your life of course<br>
				But I hope you get what you dyin' for<br>
				Be careful with me, do you know what you doin'?<br>
				Whose feelings that you're hurtin' and bruisin'?<br>
				You gon' gain the whole world<br>
				But is it worth the girl that you're losin'?<br>
				Be careful with me<br>
				Yeah, it's not a threat, it's a warnin'<br>
				Be careful with me<br>
				Yeah, my heart is like a package with a fragile label on it<br>
				Be careful with me<br>
			</p>
