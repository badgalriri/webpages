				<h3>Intro</h3>
				<p>
					Yeah
					Care for me, care for me, care for me, uh
					Yeah, look
				</p>
			</div>

				<h3>Verse 1</h3>
				<p>
					I wanna get married, like the Currys, Steph and Ayesha shit<br>
					But we more like Bellyâ€”Tommy and Keisha shit<br>
					Gave you TLC, you wanna creep and shit<br>
					Poured out my whole heart to a piece of shit<br>
					Man, I thought you would've learned your lesson<br>
					'Bout likin' pictures, not returnin' texts<br>
					I guess it's fine, man, I get the message<br>
					You still stutter after certain questions<br>
					You keep in contact with certain exes<br>
					Do you, though, trust me, nigga, it's cool, though<br>
					Said that you was workin', but you out here chasin' culo<br>
					And putas, chillin' poolside, livin' two lives<br>
					I could've did what you did to me to you a few times<br>
					But if I did decide to slide, find a nigga<br>
					Fuck him, suck his dick, you would've been pissed<br>
					But that's not my M.O., I'm not that type of bitch<br>
					And karma for you is gon' be who you end up with<br>
					You make me sick, nigga<br>
				</p>

				<h3>Chorus</h3>
				<p>
					The only man, baby, I adore<br>
					I gave you everything, what's mine is yours<br>
					I want you to live your life of course<br>
					But I hope you get what you dyin' for<br>
					Be careful with me, do you know what you doin'?<br>
					Whose feelings that you're hurtin' and bruisin'?<br>
					You gon' gain the whole world<br>
					But is it worth the girl that you're losin'?<br>
					Be careful with me<br>
					Yeah, it's not a threat, it's a warnin'<br>
					Be careful with me<br>
					Yeah, my heart is like a package with a fragile label on it<br>
					Be careful with me<br>
				</p>

			<h3>Bridge</h3>
			<p>
				Care for me, care for me<br>
				Always said that you'd be there for me, there for me<br>
				Boy, you better treat me carefully, carefully, look<br>
			</p>


			<h3>Verse 2</h3>
			<p>
				I was here before all of this<br>
				Guess you actin' out now, you got an audience<br>
				Tell me where your mind is, drop a pin, what's the coordinates?<br>
				You might have a fortune, but you lose me, you still gon' be misfortunate, nigga<br>
				Tell me, this love's got you this fucked up in the head<br>
				You want some random bitch up in your bed?<br>
				She don't even know your middle name, watch her 'cause she might steal your chain<br>
				You don't want someone who loves you instead? I guess not though<br>
				It's blatant disrespect, you nothin' like the nigga I met<br>
				Talk to me crazy and you quick to forget<br>
				You even got me trippin', you got me lookin' in the mirror different<br>
				Thinkin' I'm flawed because you inconsistent<br>
				Between a rock and a hard place, the mud and the dirt<br>
				It's gon' hurt me to hate you, but lovin' you's worse<br>
				It all stops so abrupt, we started switchin' it up<br>
				Teach me to be like you so I can not give a fuck<br>
				Free to mess with someone else, I wish these feelings could melt<br>
				'Cause you don't care about a thing except your mothafuckin' self<br>
				You make me sick, nigga<br>
			</p>

			<h3>Chorus</h3>
			<p>
				The only man, baby, I adore<br>
				I gave you everything, what's mine is yours<br>
				I want you to live your life of course<br>
				But I hope you get what you dyin' for<br>
				Be careful with me, do you know what you doin'?<br>
				Whose feelings that you're hurtin' and bruisin'?<br>
				You gon' gain the whole world<br>
				But is it worth the girl that you're losin'?<br>
				Be careful with me<br>
				Yeah, it's not a threat, it's a warnin'<br>
				Be careful with me<br>
				Yeah, my heart is like a package with a fragile label on it<br>
				Be careful with me<br>
